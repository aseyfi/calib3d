    "# Camera Calibration from Scratch\n",

    "---\n",
    "This repository is mainly focused on details of camera calibration implementation in OpenCV. It include both [narrow field of view](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html) and [fisheye](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html) monocular calibration. OpenCV's camera calibration is mainly based on this [Matlab toolbox](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/index.html#links) implemented by Jean-Yves Bouguet and that is what I used as a reference to understand how the code is working. Also, I have used a few other references that are all listed at the end of this document.\n",
